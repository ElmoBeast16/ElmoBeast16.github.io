<p>The Hack:<br> In July 2015, a hacker group by the name of "The Impact Team" hacked 
Ashley Madison and stole millions of accounts with personal information. They threatened 
to release the information if the website did not shut itself down. Unable to complete the
requests, the hacker team released the information, creating a huge buzz with all of the people's 
information leaked onto the web.This could become a matter of national security, and people are 
less likely to feel as safe on the web. These people have yet to be caught and are still
on the loose.   </p></span>

<p>Social Implications:<br> Since the Ashley Madison hack, many people are afraid that their 
other information can be exposed. Also, some of the sites could be false, ruining people's reputation
just because somebody felt like it. The source code of the entire website was also leaked, potentially
providing pathways to hack other, more important websites. This is a huge find, because banks or 
government sites could get hacked. This could become a matter of national security, and people are 
less likely to feel as safe on the web. </p></span>

Dangers: <br>Like before, there are so many dangers that have arisen because of this hack on Ashley Madison.
One of them is obviously that people's information could potentially be on the web. This is a huge problem because
random other people could gain access to people of importance that could be falsely accused of using the site. Another
danger is that people could be relucant to use other sites, destroying part of the cyber community.
